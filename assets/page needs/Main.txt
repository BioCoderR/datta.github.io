About>
I'm Ira Truganini, I make movies. And I've been doing it for three years. I've made many music videos and short films, successfully pushing the conventions of their form. I am a true student of cinema, Internet helped me accumulate traditional craft and I'm always learning new age craft from creative artists around the globe. 

PICTURE>

I value commercial advertisement films and experimental cinema for its fresh perspective it brings to the filmmaker and audience. I believe it helps in compiling a list of creative hypothesis which can be used in conventional cinema.
